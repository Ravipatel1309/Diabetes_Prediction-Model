# Diabetes_Prediction-Model
The Diabetes prediction model is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on a set of input variables such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose level, and other relevant health indicators.

This model has been trained using a large dataset of medical records, and uses advanced statistical techniques and algorithms to analyze the data and make accurate predictions.By providing early detection and intervention, this model can help prevent the onset of diabetes and its associated complications, improving overall health outcomes and quality of life.

The code for this model is available on GitHub, and can be easily integrated into other applications or systems. It is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, allowing for easy adaptation to a wide range of use cases and scenarios.
